# collabland-to-harmony-port-or-support-to-bot
# Description
Make a port or add existing support to collab.land bot to allow access to Discord/Telegram communities depending on HRC token holdings with a Harmony wallet. Currently, Collab.land only works with Ethereum token standards and with Roll, using Metamask and a few other wallets.


## Context
Individual artists and DAOs want to issue NFTs and social tokens that confer benefits to the community, including access, voting, and governance. Selectively allowing community access depending on token holdings is a function that ONE needs which people do regularly on ETH, so that we can easily onboard future artists.

## Acceptance Criteria
* will work with HRC20 and HRC721, HRC1155 tokens to gate access

* will work with standard hot wallets including Harmony chrome extension and 1wallet.crazy.one wallets

- For Discord: 

    Bot will automate server permissions via HRC token holdings in hot wallets including Metamask and Harmony's - https://collab-land.gitbook.io/collab-land/bots/discord/token-permissioned-roles 

    Bot will connect with these hot wallets to allow Discord roles/channels access based on HRC tokens in the wallet, like it does with ERC tokens in Metamask: https://youtu.be/KOHYb1hKOHM and grant the correct role as in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1uL5DCId40&t=150s

    Further example: 4:30 - 5:18 and 6:00 to the end of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpKXcbkw3Bk

- For Telegram:

    Bot will integrate with Telegram group to enable token Permissioned Chat where we can create an exclusive chatroom for members who hold a certain amount of HRC tokens, with all functionality in https://collab-land.gitbook.io/collab-land/bots/telegram and its subpages.
